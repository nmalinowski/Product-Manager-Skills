## Revenue Metrics

### Revenue
```
Period: [Month/Quarter/Year]
Total Customer Payments: $__________
Revenue = $__________
```

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
```
Total Revenue: $__________
Total Users: __________
ARPU = Total Revenue / Total Users = $__________
```

### ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account)
```
MRR: $__________
Active Accounts: __________
ARPA = MRR / Active Accounts = $__________
```

### ARPA/ARPU Analysis
```
ARPA: $__________
ARPU: $__________
Average Seats per Account = ARPA / ARPU = __________
```

### ACV (Annual Contract Value)
```
Annual Recurring Revenue per Contract: $__________
(Exclude one-time fees like setup, professional services)
ACV = $__________
```

### MRR/ARR
```
Starting MRR: $__________

MRR Components:
+ New MRR (new customers): $__________
+ Expansion MRR (upsells/cross-sells): $__________
- Churned MRR (lost customers): $__________
- Contraction MRR (downgrades): $__________

Ending MRR: $__________
ARR = MRR × 12 = $__________
```

### Gross vs. Net Revenue
```
Gross Revenue: $__________
- Discounts: $__________
- Refunds: $__________
- Credits: $__________
Net Revenue = $__________

Discount Rate = Discounts / Gross Revenue = __________%
Refund Rate = Refunds / Gross Revenue = __________%
```

## Retention & Expansion Metrics

### Churn Rate (Monthly)
```
Logo Churn:
Starting Customers: __________
Customers Lost: __________
Logo Churn Rate = Customers Lost / Starting Customers = __________%

Revenue Churn:
Starting MRR: $__________
MRR Lost: $__________
Revenue Churn Rate = MRR Lost / Starting MRR = __________%
```

**Convert to Annual Churn:**
```
Monthly Churn Rate: __________%
Annual Churn Rate = 1 - (1 - Monthly Churn)^12 = __________%
```

### NRR (Net Revenue Retention)
```
Starting ARR: $__________
+ Expansion Revenue: $__________
- Churned Revenue: $__________
- Contraction Revenue: $__________
Ending ARR (from cohort): $__________

NRR = Ending ARR / Starting ARR × 100 = __________%
```

### Expansion Revenue
```
Upsells (tier upgrades): $__________
Cross-sells (add-ons): $__________
Usage growth: $__________
Total Expansion Revenue: $__________

Expansion as % of MRR = Expansion / Total MRR = __________%
```

### Quick Ratio
```
New MRR: $__________
Expansion MRR: $__________
Churned MRR: $__________
Contraction MRR: $__________

Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR)
Quick Ratio = __________
```

## Benchmarks & Quality Checks

### Revenue Metrics
- [ ] Gross vs. net revenue clearly labeled
- [ ] Revenue growth rate > cost growth rate
- [ ] ARPU/ARPA tracked by cohort (not just blended)
- [ ] Revenue concentration: Top customer <10%, Top 10 <40%

### Retention Metrics
- [ ] Monthly churn <5% (ideally <2%)
- [ ] Revenue churn vs. logo churn compared
- [ ] NRR >100% (ideally >120%)
- [ ] Quick Ratio >2 (ideally >4)

### Cohort Analysis
- [ ] Recent cohorts perform same or better than older cohorts
- [ ] Revenue retention tracked, not just logo retention
- [ ] Expansion analyzed by cohort

## Red Flags

Check if any of these apply:

- [ ] Revenue churn > logo churn (losing big customers)
- [ ] ARPU growing but customer count shrinking (mix shift, not improvement)
- [ ] Newer cohorts churn faster than older cohorts (PMF degradation)
- [ ] NRR <100% (contracting, not expanding)
- [ ] Quick Ratio <2 (leaky bucket)
- [ ] Discounts >20% or refunds >10% (pricing/product problems)
- [ ] Revenue concentration >50% in top 10 customers (risk)
- [ ] Expansion revenue <10% of total MRR (monetization problem)
